# TCL Scripting Journey for VLSI

This repository documents my learning path in TCL scripting, starting from foundational concepts to advanced scripting practices for VLSI Physical Design automation. Each script is created, tested, and documented as I progress through real-world use cases, tool-based scripting, and EDA automation.

## What You'll Find Here

- Basics: Variables, loops, conditionals, procedures
- File handling and string operations
- Intermediate logic-building exercises
- Tool-oriented scripts for Physical Design (e.g., floorplanning, placement, STA)
- Utility scripts for debugging and parsing
- Custom automation helpers used in Synopsys and Cadence flows

## Tools of Focus

- Synopsys: ICC2, Design Compiler, PrimeTime
- Cadence: Innovus, Genus
- Mentor: Calibre (LVS/DRC)

## Goal

To build a reusable, growing TCL library while strengthening understanding of scripting for automation in the VLSI industry.
